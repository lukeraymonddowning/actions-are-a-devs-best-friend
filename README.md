# Talk: Actions Are a Dev's Best Friend

Here is the content from my talk at Laracon Winter 2022. You'll find my presentation in the `slides` directory.

There are 4 branches:

1) main - The codebase as it was at the very start of the presentation
2) the_end_result - The codebase after refactoring to actions
3) with_artisan - The terrible idea of refactoring to Artisan commands as an abstraction
4) with_model - The slightly better (but still questionable) idea of putting our abstracted logic in the model
